# Agentic AI Bootcamp

The Agentic AI Bootcamp helps developers get started with building AI agents that can interact with external tools, data sources, and services. The labs guide participants through deploying NVIDIA® NIM™ microservices via cloud and local endpoints, and implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized AI-to-tool communication. Attendees will build MCP servers using both high-level (FastMCP) and low-level SDKs, exploring Stdio and HTTP transports for local and remote deployments. Participants will also design agentic workflows using LangGraph's StateGraph to orchestrate multi-step reasoning and tool invocation. The bootcamp concludes with a hands-on challenge where attendees build a complete AI agent integrating Q&A and Invoice MCP servers.

### Deployment Options

This bootcamp supports two flexible deployment configurations:

**Option 1: Cloud-Based Deployment**

When following `01_inference_endpoint.ipynb`, execute the **Cloud Endpoint** section and skip the **Local Endpoint** section.

- **Hardware Requirements:** Any standard laptop or workstation (GPU not required)
- **NIM Configuration:** Connects to NVIDIA AI cloud endpoints through API access
- **Estimated Setup:** Approximately 10 minutes

**Option 2: Self-Hosted Deployment**

When following `01_inference_endpoint.ipynb`, execute the **Local Endpoint** section and skip the **Cloud Endpoint** section.

- **Hardware Requirements:** GPU-enabled infrastructure (e.g., GPU node or cluster)
- **NIM Configuration:** Run NVIDIA NIM microservices directly on your own hardware
- **Estimated Setup:** Approximately 25 minutes (including NIM service deployment)

### Tested environment

We tested and ran all labs on a DGX machine equipped with an Ampere A100 and H100 GPU.

# Deploying the Labs

#### 1. Setting up a Virtual Environment

First, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
https://github.com/openhackathons-org/agentic-ai-bootcamp
cd agentic-ai-bootcamp
```

Create and activate a new virtual environment:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv agentic-ai-env

# Activate virtual environment
source agentic-ai-env/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Installing Required Packages

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:
```bash
# Upgrade pip (recommended)
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install requirements
pip install -r https://github.com/openhackathons-org/agentic-ai-bootcamp/blob/main/requirements.txt 
```


#### 3. Verifying GPU Access

**Note:** This step is only applicable if you have GPU access. If you're using the cloud-based deployment option, you may skip this section.

To confirm that your environment can successfully detect and access GPU resources, execute the following Python commands:

```python
import torch

# Check if CUDA is available
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")

# If CUDA is available, show device information
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"Current device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    print(f"Device count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
```

You can run these commands either in a Python terminal or by creating a simple script.

#### 4. Starting JupyterLab

To start JupyterLab on port 8888:
```bash
#Choose the desired workspace:
cd workspace-nim-with-rag
# Basic start
jupyter lab --port 8888

# If you want to make it accessible from other machines on your network
jupyter lab --port 8888 --ip 0.0.0.0

# If you want to specify a particular browser
jupyter lab --port 8888 --browser="chrome"
```

After running the command, you should see output similar to:
```
[I 2025-01-29 10:00:00.000 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /path/to/extension
[I 2025-01-29 10:00:00.000 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /path/to/app
[I 2025-01-29 10:00:00.000 ServerApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /path/to/your/project
[I 2025-01-29 10:00:00.000 ServerApp] Jupyter Server 1.x is running at:
[I 2025-01-29 10:00:00.000 ServerApp] http://localhost:8888/lab
```

Copy the URL from the output and paste it into your browser. If prompted for a token, you can find it in the terminal output.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Virtual Environment Issues**
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory when creating the virtual environment
   - Verify that the virtual environment is activated (you should see `(agentic-ai-env)` in your terminal prompt)

2. **Package Installation Issues**
   - Try updating pip before installing requirements: `pip install --upgrade pip`
   - If a package fails to install, try installing it separately

3. **GPU Access Issues**
   - Ensure NVIDIA drivers are properly installed
   - Check if CUDA toolkit is installed and matches your PyTorch version
   - Run `nvidia-smi` in terminal to verify GPU is recognized

4. **JupyterLab Access Issues**
   - Make sure port 8888 is not being used by another application
   - If accessing from another machine, ensure firewall settings allow the connection
   - Try a different port if 8888 is unavailable

For additional help, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.

Open the browser at `http://localhost:8888` and go click on the `start_here.ipynb`. As soon as you are done with the rest of the labs, shut down jupyter lab by selecting `File > Shut Down` and the container by typing `exit` or pressing `ctrl+d` in the terminal window.

Congratulations, you've successfully built and deployed an Agentic AI Bootcamp!
